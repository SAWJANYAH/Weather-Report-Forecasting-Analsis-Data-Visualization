[Project link](https://hicounselor.com/hc_projects)

Weather prediction is one of the most certainly required information in all over the regions It involves collecting global meteorological surface and upper-air observations, preparing global surface and upper air pressure, temperature, moisture, and wind analyses at frequent time intervals based upon these observations we predict some data for upcoming days weather conditions.

This data contains day wise weather attributes from 2022 to July 2033 (predicted data)
NOTE:the given data requires cleaning and analysis to proceed further for any analysis.

The Project will consist of 2 modules:
Module 1: Pre-processing, Analysing data using Python and SQL.
Module 2: Visualizing data using Power BI.
